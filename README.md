# Credit Risk Prediction Model - README

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a credit risk prediction model to identify default-prone customers using advanced machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques. The approach integrates Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), K-Means clustering, and optimization methods to enhance model interpretability and accuracy.

---

## Objectives
1. **Predict Credit Risk**: Develop a model capable of accurately identifying customers likely to default on their credit card payments.
2. **Segment Clients**: Group clients into distinct risk categories to enable targeted interventions and strategies.
3. **Optimize Model Performance**: Address multicollinearity and dimensionality issues to improve predictive reliability.

---

## Key Results
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved 96% accuracy in predicting default-prone customers using NMF-engineered features.
- **Client Segmentation**: Identified four distinct client risk groups using K-Means clustering, with high-risk clusters showing default rates exceeding 95%.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced model efficiency and accuracy by addressing multicollinearity and reducing dimensionality with PCA and SVD.

---

## Techniques and Tools
- **Feature Engineering**: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for latent feature extraction.
- **Clustering**: K-Means for client segmentation based on extracted latent features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to optimize model performance.
- **Programming**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn).

---

## Business Impact
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifying high-risk clients allows financial institutions to proactively mitigate credit defaults.
- **Targeted Strategies**: Segmented risk groups enable tailored interventions, improving customer management and resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: NMF and clustering provide actionable insights for data-driven decisions.

## Future Enhancements
1. **SMOTE Analysis**: Address class imbalance.
2. **Explore Other Models**: Test advanced machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks) for potential performance improvements.
